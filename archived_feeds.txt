Ensures that shape points are sorted by shape_pt_sequence before truncating them as part of the through-routing process.; Why this matters: The bus detour patch adds new points to trips' shapes. Those new points are added to the end of the shapes.txt file, even if the points are not chronologically at the end of the shape/trip. This is usually not a problem since GTFS consumers are supposed to order points by shape_pt_sequence. These very particular trips, however, are affected by a through-routing script which breaks apart the trips into two or more parts. Consequently, the shapes get split up.; We try to be smart about splitting the shapes nearest specified start/end stop IDs, but don't do anything to make sure the points in the shape are first ordered properly. We assume they're already ordered by shape_pt_sequence since they usually already are, except in the edge case of shape patches. This commit resolves the conflict."
